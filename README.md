<h1>Keylogger Project</h1> 

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I coded a simple keylogger that records every keystroke that is made on a computer keyboard. </p>

<h2>Languages and Utilities used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
</ul>

<h2>Environments used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 10</li>
</ul>

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>
<p>Firstly, I went onto the Windows Security page to modify the virus & threat protection settings. I added the Keylogger python file as an exclusion to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans so that the code is exempt from destruction.</p>

<p>Then, I installed pynput in python and wrote the code.</p>

<p>To test if the code works, I ran it and input random letters to see if a keyfile is generated.</p>

<p>A keyfile was generated with all the letters recorded.</p>
